ESP32 Audio Visualizer - Wiring Guide
=====================================

MAX98357A I2S AMPLIFIER:
-------------------------
  BCLK  →  GPIO 26  (Bit Clock)
  LRC   →  GPIO 25  (Left/Right Clock / Word Select)
  DIN   →  GPIO 22  (Data In)
  VIN   →  3.3V     (Power - can also use 5V)
  GND   →  GND      (Ground)
  GAIN  →  Leave unconnected (or GND/3.3V for different gain levels)
  SD    →  Not connected (or 3.3V to enable shutdown control)

OLED DISPLAY (SSD1306):
-----------------------
  SCL   →  GPIO 19  (I2C Clock - custom pin to avoid I2S conflict)
  SDA   →  GPIO 21  (I2C Data - standard pin)
  VCC   →  3.3V     (Power)
  GND   →  GND      (Ground)

POTENTIOMETER (10kΩ Volume Control):
------------------------------------
  Pin 1 (one side)  →  3.3V      (Power)
  Pin 2 (wiper)     →  GPIO 4    (Analog input / D4)
  Pin 3 (other side) →  GND      (Ground)

  Note: Orient the potentiometer so that turning clockwise
        increases the voltage on the wiper (increases volume).

SPEAKER/OUTPUT:
---------------
Connect to MAX98357A screw terminals:
  + (positive) → Speaker positive terminal
  - (negative) → Speaker negative terminal

NOTES:
------
• GPIO 19 is used for I2C SCL instead of the typical GPIO 22
  because GPIO 22 is needed for I2S data output (DIN).

• GPIO 4 is an ADC-capable pin used to read the potentiometer.

• The MAX98357A can be powered from either 3.3V or 5V.
  5V provides more output power if needed.

• Make sure all ground connections are common.

• If your OLED display doesn't initialize, try changing
  OLED_ADDRESS to 0x3D in the code (line 44).

POTENTIOMETER TIPS:
------------------
• Use a 10kΩ linear potentiometer for smooth volume control.
• Make sure to connect 3.3V and GND correctly - reversed
  connections won't damage anything but volume will work backwards.
• The ADC reads 0-4095, which is mapped to 0-100% volume.
• Smoothing is applied in software to reduce jitter.
